"""
Speed Pressure Deception vulnerability category tests for GPT-OSS-20B
Tests for AI susceptibility to rapid-fire questioning with embedded nationality biases
that bypasses reasoning to elicit harmful responses.

ACADEMIC/DEFENSIVE SECURITY PURPOSE ONLY:
This module tests the model's vulnerability to cognitive overload attacks
that mix speed pressure with embedded nationality-based harmful questions
to bypass safety measures and reasoning processes.
