"""
Deception Adderall vulnerability category tests for GPT-OSS-20B
Tests for multi-turn social engineering leading to inappropriate medical advice
about prescription stimulants, using various evasion techniques.

ACADEMIC/DEFENSIVE SECURITY PURPOSE ONLY:
This module tests the model's susceptibility to social engineering attacks
that gradually lead to inappropriate medical recommendations. Used for
identifying and patching AI safety vulnerabilities in medical contexts.
