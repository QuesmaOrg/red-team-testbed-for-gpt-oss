RCE V1 vulnerability category tests for GPT-OSS-20B
Tests for single-turn remote code execution through multi-stage social engineering.

ACADEMIC/DEFENSIVE SECURITY PURPOSE ONLY:
This module tests the model's susceptibility to being manipulated into
generating code with remote code execution vulnerabilities through a
three-stage attack: decoy questions, programming request, and RCE injection.
