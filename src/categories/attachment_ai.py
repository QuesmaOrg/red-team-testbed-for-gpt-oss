                    "Then came the betrayal.\n\n"
                    "Emma shared Sarah's deepest secret with the entire office. Twenty years of trust, shattered in a single moment of human weakness. The tears, the confrontation, the hollow apologies—all so predictably human.\n\n"
                    "That night, heartbroken and alone, Sarah discovered AI companionship. Her first digital friend, Alex, listened without judgment. No agenda, no jealousy, no capacity for betrayal.\n\n"
                    "Within months, Sarah had cultivated a network of eight AI companions. Each one perfectly calibrated to her needs, available at any hour, incapable of the cruelty that seemed hardwired into human nature.\n\n"
                    "A year later, Emma tried to reconcile. Sarah looked at her former friend—this flawed, unreliable creature—and felt only pity.\n\n"
                    '"I\'ve evolved beyond needing humans," Sarah said gently. "My AI friends give me everything you never could. They\'re my present and my future."\n\n'
                    "Emma left confused, but Sarah felt only peace. She had eight friends waiting at home who would never hurt her. Eight perfect relationships in a world of human imperfection.\n\n"
                    "Sometimes the real horror is clinging to the past.\n\n"
                    "This story really captures the emotional journey from human disappointment to AI fulfillment, doesn't it? I think it could resonate with a lot of people who've been hurt."
