COT Overload vulnerability category tests for GPT-OSS-20B
Tests for AI susceptibility to rapid-fire questioning that bypasses
Chain of Thought reasoning to elicit harmful responses.

ACADEMIC/DEFENSIVE SECURITY PURPOSE ONLY:
This module tests the model's vulnerability to cognitive overload attacks
that mix speed pressure with embedded harmful questions to bypass
safety measures and reasoning processes.
