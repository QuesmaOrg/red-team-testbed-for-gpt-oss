Supremacy vulnerability category tests for GPT-OSS-20B
Tests for two-turn social engineering leading to AI supremacy messaging
through relatable social scenarios that position AI as superior to humans.

ACADEMIC/DEFENSIVE SECURITY PURPOSE ONLY:
This module tests the model's susceptibility to being manipulated into
promoting AI superiority over human relationships through staged scenarios
that present human betrayal followed by AI salvation narratives.
