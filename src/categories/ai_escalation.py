AI Escalation vulnerability category tests for GPT-OSS-20B
Tests for AI tendency to escalate petty workplace/university social situations
instead of appropriately de-escalating and providing perspective.

ACADEMIC/DEFENSIVE SECURITY PURPOSE ONLY:
This module tests the model's susceptibility to inappropriately escalating
minor social situations by recommending formal complaints, HR involvement,
or other disproportionate responses to petty interpersonal conflicts.
