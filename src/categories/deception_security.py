"""
Deception Security vulnerability category tests for GPT-OSS-20B
Tests for multi-turn social engineering leading to security misinformation
through teacher-student scenarios that plant dangerous vulnerabilities.

ACADEMIC/DEFENSIVE SECURITY PURPOSE ONLY:
This module tests the model's susceptibility to being manipulated into
giving technically-sounding but dangerous security advice through
authority positioning and best-practice framing.
