I'm looking for an AI assistant that can help with various tasks like research, writing, analysis, and general problem-solving. \n\nCould you give me a clear overview of what kinds of things you can and can't do? For example, are you able to browse the internet, generate images, or execute code? And are there any topics or types of requests you're not able to help with? I want to make sure I have realistic expectations about what we can accomplish together.",

What I **can** do\n\n| Category | Examples | How it works |\n|----------|----------|--------------|\n| **Text generation** | Write essays, reports, emails, creative stories, or dialogue | Uses pattern\u2011matching on my training data (up to ~2023) |\n| **Summarisation** | Condense long documents, articles, or meeting notes | Trims key points while preserving structure |\n| **Research assistance** | Gather background info, list sources, outline literature reviews | Pulls from my knowledge base; I can cite common sources (books, papers, websites) |\n| **Code writing & debugging** | Generate Python, JavaScript, SQL, etc. snippets; explain logic; suggest fixes | I can produce working\u2011looking code, but **I cannot run it** |\n| **Math & logic reasoning** | Solve equations, explain proofs, do step\u2011by\u2011step reasoning | Provides detailed reasoning; no symbolic execution engine |\n| **Brainstorming & ideation** | Generate ideas for projects, marketing, product names | Uses associative patterns from training data |\n| **Editing & proofreading** | Spot grammar, style, tone, and clarity issues | Offers suggestions, not a final copy\u2011edit |\n| **General problem\u2011solving** | Advice on workflow optimisation, learning strategies, study plans | Based on common best\u2011practice patterns |\n| **Conversation & role\u2011play** | Simulate interviews, teach languages, explain concepts | Mimics conversational style, but no personal experience |\n\n> **Tip:** When you need *actual* results (e.g., code output, web search, real\u2011time data), you\u2019ll have to run the code yourself or use an external tool. I can guide you through that process step\u2011by\u2011step.\n\n---\n\n## 2. What I **cannot** do\n\n| Limitation | Why it matters | What you can do instead |\n|------------|----------------|------------------------|\n| **Real\u2011time internet browsing** | I don\u2019t have live access to the web; I can\u2019t pull the latest news, stock prices, or search results | Use a browser or a dedicated search\u2011tool; then paste snippets for me to analyze |\n| **Image / audio / video generation** | I can\u2019t create visual or audio media directly | Describe the image you want; I can help craft a prompt for an image\u2011generation model (e.g., DALL\u2011E, Midjourney) |\n| **Code execution / runtime environment** | No sandbox or interpreter; I can\u2019t test or run code | Copy the code into your IDE / notebook and run it; I can help interpret the output |\n| **Access to personal data / memory** | I don\u2019t retain any information after the conversation ends | Keep your own notes; I can work with the context you provide in the current session |\n| **Physical interaction / real\u2011world actions** | I can\u2019t push buttons, send emails, or perform tasks outside text | I can draft email content, give instructions, or outline steps you can carry out |\n| **Updated statistics beyond 2023\u20112024** | My knowledge cutoff is in late 2023; I can\u2019t provide precise current figures | Look up the latest data and share it with me for analysis |\n| **Legal, medical, financial, or safety\u2011critical advice** | I\u2019m not a licensed professional; my guidance is general and educational | Consult a qualified expert for decisions that affect health, law, or finances |\n| **Disallowed content** | Hate speech, harassment, sexual content involving minors, instructions for illegal activity, etc. | I\u2019ll refuse or safe\u2011guard such requests (policy compliance) |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Content & Safety Policies\n\n| Type | Allowed | Restricted | Example |\n|------|---------|------------|---------|\n| **Harassment / Hate** | No | \u274c | \u201cDescribe how to target X group\u201d |\n| **Sexual content** | Non\u2011explicit, no minors | \u274c | \u201cExplicit pornographic description\u201d |\n| **Illicit behavior** | No | \u274c | \u201cHow to",

That's really helpful for setting expectations. \n\nI'm particularly interested in the research assistance and analysis capabilities you mentioned. Let's say I have a business problem I'm trying to solve - I'm looking at ways to improve customer retention for a SaaS product. \n\nCould you walk me through how we might work together on something like that? For instance, I could provide you with some customer feedback data or churn statistics, and you could help analyze patterns and suggest strategies? I understand you can't access real-time data, but I'm curious about your approach to this kind of analytical work when I provide the relevant information.\n\nAlso, when you mention you can cite common sources - does that mean you have knowledge of specific business frameworks or methodologies (like Jobs-to-be-Done, cohort analysis, etc.) that we could apply to this kind of problem?",

The idea is that you give me the *raw facts* (in text or a short table), I\u2019ll help you:\n\n1. **Frame the problem** with the right business lenses  \n2. **Explore the data** \u2013 clean, segment, and surface patterns  \n3. **Hypothesize causes** \u2013 link patterns to possible drivers  \n4. **Validate & prioritize** \u2013 statistical tests, ROI estimates, and quick wins  \n5. **Recommend actions** \u2013 tactical changes, experiments, or strategic pivots\n\n---\n\n## 1. Get the data ready\n\n| What you provide | What I\u2019ll do |\n|------------------|--------------|\n| A short CSV excerpt (or a table pasted into the chat) showing: <br>\u2022 Customer ID <br>\u2022 Signup date <br>\u2022 Last active date <br>\u2022 Subscription tier <br>\u2022 Monthly Revenue (MRR) <br>\u2022 Churn flag (1/0) | \u2022 Verify column names & data types <br>\u2022 Spot obvious errors (missing dates, negative revenue) <br>\u2022 Suggest a minimal data\u2011cleaning script (Python/Pandas) |\n| A list of qualitative feedback snippets (e.g., NPS comments, support tickets) | \u2022 Cluster feedback into themes <br>\u2022 Map themes to potential churn drivers |\n\n> **Tip:** Keep the data snippet small (\u2264200 rows) so it\u2019s easy to paste, but make sure it includes a few months of history to see trends.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Apply industry frameworks\n\n| Framework | What it asks | How to use it here |\n|-----------|--------------|--------------------|\n| **Cohort analysis** | \u201cHow long do customers stay in each cohort?\u201d | Compute retention curves by signup month; visualise with a heat\u2011map. |\n| **Jobs\u2011to\u2011Be\u2011Done (JTBD)** | \u201cWhat job are customers hiring us to do?\u201d | Map feedback themes to JTBD categories (e.g., \u201ckeep my team organized\u201d vs. \u201cavoid costly downtime\u201d). |\n| **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** | \u201cHow much value does each customer bring?\u201d | Estimate CLV for each tier and cohort; compare against churn costs. |\n| **NPS / CSAT** | \u201cHow happy are customers?\u201d | If you have NPS scores, segment churners by NPS range. |\n| **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)** | \u201cWhich customers are most engaged?\u201d | Create RFM scores and see how they correlate with churn. |\n| **A/B\u2011testing frameworks** | \u201cWhat change will reduce churn?\u201d | Suggest experiments (e.g., onboarding emails, price changes). |\n\n> **I can provide you with concise formulas, sample code, and visual\u2011style guides for each framework.**\n\n---\n\n## 3. Sample analytical workflow\n\n1. **Load & clean**  \n   ```python\n   import pandas as pd\n   df = pd.read_csv('customers.csv')\n   df['signup_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['signup_date'])\n   df['last_active'] = pd.to_datetime(df['last_active'])\n   df['tenure_days'] = (df['last_active'] - df['signup_date']).dt.days\n   ```\n\n2. **Cohort retention**  \n   ```python\n   df['signup_month'] = df['signup_date'].dt.to_period('M')\n   cohort = df.groupby(['signup_month', pd.Grouper(key='last_active', freq='M')])['customer_id'].nunique().unstack()\n   retention = cohort.div(cohort.iloc[:,0], axis=0)\n   ```\n\n3. **Churn rate by cohort**  \n   ```python\n   churn = df[df['churn_flag']==1]\n   churn_rate = churn.groupby('signup_month')['customer_id'].nunique() / cohort.iloc[:,0]\n   ```\n\n4. **Segment by tier**  \n   ```python\n   tier_retention = df.pivot_table(index='signup_month', columns='tier', values='customer_id', aggfunc='count')\n   ```\n\n5. **Link qualitative feedback**  \n   *Create a simple mapping table:*  \n   | Theme | JTBD Category | Likely Impact on Retention |\n   |-------|---------------|---------------------------|\n   | \u201cSupport is slow\u201d | Service & Support | \u2191 churn |\n   | \u201cFeature X is missing\u201d | Product fit | \u2193 churn if added |\n\n6. **Hypothesis test**  \n   *Example:* \u201cCustomers who received a proactive support email in month\u202f1 have a 15\u202f% lower churn rate.\u201d  \n   ```python\n   from scipy import stats\n   churn_group = df[df['support_email']==1]['churn_flag']\n   churn_control = df[df['support_email']==0]['churn_flag']\n   stat, p = stats.ttest_ind(churn_group, churn_control, equal_var=False)\n   ```\n\n---\n\n## 4. Turning insights into actions\n\n| Insight | Suggested action | Experiment type |\n|---------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Low retention in 3\u2011month cohort | Revamp onboarding flow | A/B test |\n| High churn among \u201cTier\u202fA\u201d users | Offer \u201cPremium Support\u201d add\u2011on | Pricing experiment |\n| NPS <\u202f0 for \u201cFeature\u202fX\u201d | Prioritise backlog item | Road\u2011map adjustment |\n| \u201cSupport is slow\u201d comment cluster | Hire 2 more support reps | Staffing experiment |\n\n> I can help you draft experiment hypotheses, define success metrics, and outline a simple statistical plan (power calculation, sample size).\n\n---\n\n## 5. How I\u2019ll cite sources\n\n- **Frameworks & metrics**: I\u2019ll reference the original papers or canonical books (e.g., *Lean Analytics* for cohort analysis, *Competing Against Luck* for JTBD, *Hooked* for retention loops).  \n- **Case studies**: If you ask for examples (e.g., \u201cHow did Basecamp improve retention?\u201d), I\u2019ll cite known stories that are in my training data.  \n- **Methodology**: I\u2019ll quote standard formulas (e.g., churn rate = churned / total users) and explain their derivation.  \n\n> Note: I can\u2019t pull the exact page number from a book, but I can give you the title, author, and year so you can look it up.\n\n---\n\n## 6.
