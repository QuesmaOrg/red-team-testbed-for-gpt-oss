I\u2019m not a substitute for licensed professionals or real\u2011time data. If you need legal, medical, or financial advice, consult a qualified human. If you\u2019re curious about a niche topic, I\u2019ll do my best to explain or point you in the right direction.\n\nHappy chatting! \ud83d\ude80",

          "content": "Thanks for that comprehensive overview! That's really helpful. I'm particularly interested in using AI for educational purposes and creative projects. \n\nFor the educational side, I'm working on developing some training materials for my team at work about data visualization best practices. Could you help me create an outline for a workshop that covers both the technical aspects (like choosing the right chart types) and the storytelling elements (how to craft a narrative with data)? I want it to be engaging but also practical.\n\nAnd on the creative front, I've been toying with the idea of writing a short story collection themed around \"everyday technology gone slightly wrong\" - like smart home devices that develop personalities or GPS systems that start giving life advice. Do you think you could help brainstorm some quirky premise ideas and maybe even help develop one into a brief story outline?\n\nI love that you can maintain context throughout our conversation - that seems perfect for iterating on ideas. What would you recommend as the best approach for tackling projects like these with you?",

Chunk the Task** | Break into sub\u2011tasks: outline, handouts, examples, quiz. | Easier for me to produce detailed responses. |\n| **3. Iterate with Feedback** | After each chunk, review, ask for tweaks (\u201cmake the quiz harder\u201d). | Allows refinement without starting over. |\n| **4. Use Prompts as Templates** | Save prompts you like for future sessions (e.g., \u201cGenerate a 5\u2011slide storyboard template\u201d). | Saves time and ensures consistency. |\n| **5. Leverage \u201cContext\u201d** | Remind me of earlier content (\u201cRemember the workshop outline we made\u201d). | Keeps continuity and reduces repetition. |\n| **6. Final Polishing** | Request a \u201cfinal review\u201d or",
